## 📝 Usage Examples

### Basic Optimized Search

```python
from app.rag._07_optimization import optimized_search

# Execute search with full optimization
result = optimized_search(
    query="action movies",
    search_function=your_search_function,
    user_context={"preferred_genres": ["Action", "Thriller"]}
)

# Results include optimization metadata
print(f"Cache hit: {result['optimization_info']['cache_hit']}")
print(f"Query optimized: {result['optimization_info']['query_optimized']}")
print(f"Response time: {result['search_time']:.3f}s")
```

### Cache Management

```python
from app.rag._07_optimization import get_cache_manager

cache_manager = get_cache_manager()

# Cache search results
cache_manager.put_search_results("action movies", results)

# Retrieve cached results
cached = cache_manager.get_search_results("action movies")

# Get performance statistics
stats = cache_manager.get_cache_stats()
```
